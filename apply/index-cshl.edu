<span class="contenthead">Applying to the Schatzlab</span><br><hr>

The Schatzlab is a highly interactive research group known for outstanding
research in computational biology. We are developing the computational models
and systems needed for understanding the causes of diseases, for developing
better foods and biofuels, and for unlocking the secrets of the processes of
life. This work depends on having a team of highly motivated postdocs, graduate
students, and bioinformatics engineers to explore all the different facets of
these challenges. We will work together to establish and execute a premier
research program in computational biology through the entire research life
cycle: selecting research topics, establishing milestones, developing software
and methods, analyzing data, writing papers &amp; presenting your work. As you
mature in the lab, you will be expected to take on more independence &amp;
responsibility so that you will be well prepared for your entire career path.

<span class="contenthead">Computational Post-Doctoral Researchers</span><br><hr>

Applications are invited for a 2-3 year computational postdoctoral research
position in the Schatz laboratory of Quantitative Biology at Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory.  The researcher will develop novel methods for large-scale DNA and
RNA sequence analysis related to human and/or plant genetics, such as developing
methods for discovering de novo mutations related to autism, or for assembling
and analyzing large complex plant genomes.

<br><br>

Ideal applicants will have:

<br>

<ul>
  <li>A Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, or related fields with a dissertation related to Computational Biology.</li>
  <li>Strong programming and analytical skills, including experience with next-generation sequencing data.</li>
  <li>Published at least two first author papers in English and demonstrated written communication skills in English.</li>
</ul>

<span class="contenthead">Graduate Students</span><br><hr>

Graduate students interested in computational biology are encouraged to apply to
the <a href="http://www.cshl.edu/gradschool">Watson School of Biological
Sciences</a> at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. This innovative 4-year program is
especially designed for highly focused students with a strong research background
looking for total immersion into research during their PhD program. The curriculum
is extremely focused with just a single semester of fulltime coursework, followed by an
applied laboratory rotation program, and in-depth thesis research.

<br><br>

In addition, the Schatzlab includes several students from neighboring 
<a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu">Stony Brook University</a>, in the 
<a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu">Computer Science</a>, 
<a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/biochem/mcb/">Molecular and Cellular Biology</a>, 
and <a href="http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/gen/">Genetics</a> programs.
Stony Brook University is a flagship science and engineering campus of the
State University of New York system, overing extensive courses and research
opportunities across the physical sciences.

<br><br>

All graduate students must have strong programming and analytical skills, along
with excellent communication abilities. New students will be expected to
complete a semester long rotation during which they will complete a publishable
project. Stony Brook students are encouraged to enroll in the 
<a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~skiena/549/">Introduction to Computational Biology</a>
course, during which you can learn the fundamental of computational biology, and
begin your rotation project.


<br><br><br>

<span class="contenthead">Undergraduate Students</span><br><hr>

Undergraduate students are encouraged to apply to the NSF-sponsored 
<a href="http://www.cshl.edu/education/urp">Undergraduate Research Program</a>, a 10 week 
paid summer research experience in Bioinformatics, Genetics & Genomics, Cellular and Molecular
Biology, Plant Biology, Neuroscience, and Cancer Biology. Approximately 25 students a year
are selected from around the world to work side-by-side with CSHL Investigators and
gain hands-on experience. In the past few years, my students have developed novel 
computational and mathematical methods for analyzing, plant, animal, and human genomes, several
of which have lead to significant publications.

<span class="contenthead">Facilities</span><br><hr>

The Schatzlab is housed in the Koch Building on the hillside campus of Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, just minutes from downtown Huntington, and 30 miles
east of Manhattan on the north shore of Long Island. The Koch Building is home
to CSHL's new Center for Quantitative Biology, where an interdisciplinary team
of mathematicians, physicists, statisticians, and computer scientists develop
analytical approaches to interpret and understand large and complex data sets
generated from experimental models as well as patient studies. In addition to
collaborating with other members of the Quantitative Biology Center, Schatzlab
members collaborate extensively with the other researchers on campus, and at
nearby universities and hospitals.

<br> <br>

Schatzlab members have access to considerable computational resources, including
the 2000-core CSHL shared cluster "BlueHelix", >1PB of shared storage, high-memory
servers with 512GB of RAM, a dedicated 96-core Hadoop cluster, and high-end GPUs for 
software development and data analysis. The computational development works
side-by-side with the experimentalist on campus to probe deeply into a variety of
biological systems and diseases. As such, lab members also have direct access
to the CSHL Genome Sequencing Center, which currently has more than 20 high-throughput
sequencers, including 9 Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments, 2 PacBio RS instruments, 
and several others including GA2x, MiSeq, and by Ion Torrent.
