Metassembler is a software package for reconciling assemblies produced
by <i>de novo</i> short-read assemblers such as SOAPdenovo and
ALLPATHS-LG.  The goal of assembly reconciliation, or "metassembly,"
is to combine multiple assemblies into a single genome that is
superior to all of its constituents.  By creating Metassembler, we
hope to enable researchers to perform assembly reconciliation in a
straightforward and efficient fashion, improving the overall quality
of genome assemblies.

Metassembler is free, open-source software.  The code for Metassembler
will be released shortly.
